According to the design I made a button that indicates if given pool is indexed by Jupiter
I used Sagas, because it seemed the app handles side effects mostly using it
I made the modal with status and handled the possible error
indexedPools could be an array, but I decided to use an object, because every other Saga is using it this way

I added basic stories for each component 

- If the pool doesn't exist - the button is not shown

- If the pool does exist and is indexed - button is lightened - opens modal on click

- If the pool does exist and is not indexed - button is darkened - opens modal on click

- If the pool does exist, but app got an error fetching Jupiter API, modal shows the app couldn't fetch Jupiter API correctly
